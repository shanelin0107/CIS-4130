Term project- sentiment analysis on Amazon customers review data
# Project description


In this porject, I'm going to do sentiment analysis to Amazon customer reviews data to classify customers attitude toward the products they bought. We want to know how's customers' thoughts and feeling behind their reviews to see the feedback of the products on Amazon. We need to clean the data and do text preprocessing and make them into a pipeline to prepare to train the model. We select to use logistic regression to create the model to complete this project. And in the end, we would also need to do visualization about project results and model performance graph to evaluate how's our model doing in the project.
